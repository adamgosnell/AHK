# Productivity-Setup
Using AutoHotkey and Logitech G600

Requirements:
  - Program: Autohotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
    Used to run the script
  - Program: Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/)
    Used to edit the script and referenced in some routines

Keyboard_Shortcuts.ahk is a script I run full-time on my machine. It runs on startup and lists all the hot-strings and hot-keys I use. I've redacted it (prefix r-) for public consumption, but I've notated it thoroughly. This is the bread-and-butter of the operation.

  - AutoHotkeyLogoSplash.jpg is the startup/reload visual indicator.
  
  I mention in the notations that I also use an MMO mouse (Logitech G600), so I've included screenshots of how I map the buttons and a script that I use to splash the map on-screen.
  
  - g600_key_n.png is the image used in the splash code, it shows how the keys on the mouse (in "normal" mode) are mapped.
  - g600_key_n Splash.ahk is the script that splashes g600_key_n.png 
  - g600_key_g.png is the image used in the splash code, it shows how the keys on the mouse (in "G-Shift" mode) are mapped.
  - g600_key_g Splash.ahk is the script that splashes g600_key_g.png
